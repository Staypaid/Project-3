About:  When service men and women are deployed over seas, their families are often left with extra responsibilities and no one to help them.  Patriot App was created in order to help our military personnel and their loved ones by creating a community dedicated to helping and supporting one another.  Within the app you can post tasks you need assisstance with, offer to help others, send items to deployed persons, find community events, and live chat with other members.
